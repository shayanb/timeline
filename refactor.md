The idea is to refactor the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain. The current code has all functionality in script.js, and all the html components in index.html. The css style can also be modularized. The goal is to create a more structured project with separate files for different functionalities.


Don't do too much file separation, just enough to make it more modular (like timeline ui, tests, components etc).

update the tests to reflect the new structure and ensure they still pass.
update the documentation to reflect the new structure and ensure it is up to date.
